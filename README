1. Make sure Hamachi is installed and configured correctly
2. Store your Hamachi network join password stored in your keychain.app, where:
   a. <Name:> is set to 'Hamachi' (without quotes)
   b. <Account:> set to your network name (as listed below)
3. Double click the startHamachi.command file to install.
   notes: 
   a. you will be asked if the script may access your password in keychain (once during install and every time you are disjoined from the network)
   b. it might require a reboot before it actually runs

 Optional: set environment variable HAMACHI_NETWORK that stores the hamachi network name
  - set an environment variable in ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist (reboot required)
  - a pref pane for editing environment.plist is available on http://www.epikentros.net/Main/Mac_Software.html
  - without this environment variable, its value will be stored in a file name startHamachiParams.sh
  - this var is stored in the environment or startHamachiParams.sh to not needing to edit this startHamachi.sh file after an upgrade (separation of data and program logic)

This script runs on login via launchd by ~/LaunchAgents/nl.probackup.startHamachi.plist

To uninstall, in Terminal.app enter $ startHamachi.command remove

Tested on Mac OS X 10.6.8
